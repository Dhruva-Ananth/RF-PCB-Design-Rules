# Architecture Development
As a systems engineer I wish to look at things from the bigger perspective and derive certain road maps for the design creation. 

Think of it like developing an Algorithm, an overview of things with a fundamental mathematics is needed.
Here the fundamental knowledge needed is generally about the RF and Electromagnetic Theories.

## Specifications
These arrive generally as a strong foothold for the design development, before the architecture or the specs, there exists an Idea.

First and foremost, put it on Pen and Paper, and define what part of the Idea needs this development of hardware and how are you coping up with the software development.

Once you know what is on the line for the development process, you need to push the idea to a stage of rough specifications. What all should they include?
