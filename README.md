# RF-PCB-Design-Rules
Gathering all the experiences of RF PCB designers to develop a documentation for any future PCB designer to follow up on.

Division of the Sections:
1. Overall Architecture Design with an Example (easy and complex ones) - 23-01-23
2. Schematic making with example (easy and complex ones) - 30-01-23
3. PCB making video for both.
4. Design Verification by simulation.
5. Some PCB design examples for remembering thumb rules.

Anyone interested in collaborating to develop this, please do drop an email to ananthadattadhruva@gmail.com. Any help is highly appreciated, thanks!
