# RF-PCB-Design-Rules
Gathering all the experiences of RF PCB designers to develop a documentation for any future PCB designer to follow up on.

Division of the Sections:
1. Overall Architecture Design with an Example (easy and complex ones) - 7-1-23
2. Schematic making with example (easy and complex ones) - 14-1-23
3. PCB making video for both.
4. Design Verification by simulation.
5. Some PCB design examples for remembering thumb rules.
